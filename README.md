# Asset-Cafe
a mock social media blogging platform where users are grouped based on the "vibe" or aesthetic of their profile icons.
Users choose from a predefined set of assets) and create blog posts. The application will use image analysis techniques to determine the "vibe" of each profile image and automatically assign users to specific groups based on similarities in the visual characteristics of their icons.
(THE PART ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY ASSINGING USERS TO SPECFIC GROUPS BASED ON SIMILARITIES IN THE VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR ICONS IS SOMETHING I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO DO JUST YEAT BUT..... BEAR WITH ME)
